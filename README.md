## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Get required .env files.**

    This Gatsby site needs two .env files, one each for the development and production environment variables. The below individuals can provide them to you on request, since they contain secure info. _Take care not to track .env files in Git since it is not safe to store secure info in Git._

2.  **Place .env files in project root directory (i.e., `schmidt/`)**

    Place the .env files in your project root directory so the Node and Gatsby scripts can reference them.


3.  **Install packages**

    Do `npm install` from the project root directory.


4. **Start API server**

    Clone repo `schmidt-api` and follow the README instructions to get it started.


5. **Start Gatsby development server**

    Do `gatsby develop` from the project root directory to start the project and check `localhost:8000` for the site.
